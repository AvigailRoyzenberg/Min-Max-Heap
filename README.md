# Min-Max-Heap


The Min-Max Heap is a data structure that combines the uses of a max-heap and a min-heap. 

This means we can achieve:

- retrieval in O(1) time  

- insertion/deletion in O(log(n)) time 

of both the mins and maxes.



At even levels of the tree - each node is less then all of its children, 

while at odd levels - each node is greater than all of its children.
